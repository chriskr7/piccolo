Examples
========

Prerequisites


1. requests package MUST BE installed in your environment.

2. If Piccolo's config file set to use REST-API-KEY, then you should copy signature.py into
   your working directory to produce REST-API-KEY or use your own module to produce the key using
   hmac-sha-256 equivalent.

3. This examples are to show you how to interface with Piccolo in your code so you should not
   think this as the elegant way.  Since it's just a reference to show you how to use it, you should
   design your way to meet your needs.

4. Secret key is pre-defined but it may be changable in the future to receive the key when you
   log-in to Piccolo.
